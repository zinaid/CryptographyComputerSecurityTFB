    "* Interpreted - there is no need to compile program before execution (Like PHP or PERL)\n",
    "* Object oriented - Python allows object oriented style and design.\n",
    "* Python allows functional and structural programming and methods\n",
    "* Python can be used as scripting or as a programming language\n",
